# cat-rainmeter-skin

Based on [dule23's Rainmeter skin](https://www.deviantart.com/dule23/art/Catppuccin-Rainmeter-skin-914252677/) (which also has a top bar for unix systems, go check it, it looks cool).

Made these changes for myself, but made it public because why not.

It is not intended for easy setup, specially if you never used Rainmeter but i wrote something to help setup this.

## Setup

In case you want to try it and never have used Rainmeter before :

- Install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)

- Clone this repo in Documents/Rainmeter/Skins

- From Rainmeter activate all the skin elements

- Drag the elements to the place of your choice (RMB > Parameters > Stick to edge to disable the sticking thing)

To customize the location, metrics and language edit @Resources/styles.inc<br>
More help about this in @Resources/WeatherData/MeasureNamesReference.txt

There are a lot of things you can easily change, just dig in the files !
